  <h2>Experience:</h2>

    <h3>Editor-in-Chief</h3>
    <h4>Bi-College News</h4>
    <h5>2017 – 2018</h5>
	    <p>As editor-in chief, I led weekly meetings and assigned topics to a staff of about 20 writers. I also edited all submitted articles using AP style written for both our bi-semester print and weekly online editions. I spearheaded the layout for the print edition and instructed staff on how to use InDesign. I updated our website, <a href="http://bicollegenews.com/"> The Bi-College News</a>, weekly with new content.</p>

    <h3>Peer Writing Tutor</h3>
    <h4>Bryn Mawr College</h4>
    <h5>September 2017 – December 2017</h5>
      <p>As a Peer Writing Tutor, I held four walk-in hours per week to assist students with the process of writing or public speaking. I had knowledge of and taught skills such as constructing a thesis, structuring the essay, and making sense of material. I worked with ESL and first-year students to develop collegiate writing fundamentals. Finally, I met weekly with two semester-long students to work on long-term projects and writing development.</p>

    <h3>Staff Writer, Editor, and Social Media Manager</h3>
    <h4>Au'Loni Magazine</h4>
    <h5>May 2017 – September 2017</h5>
      <p>As a summer staff member of the entrepreneurial <a href="http://www.aulonimagazine.com/">online</a> magazine Au’Loni, I wrote three to five well-researched articles per month on topics pertaining to entrepreneurship, small-business owners, and business. I compiled a monthly "event scroll" comprised of entrepreneurial events in the Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. areas that was published online for our readers. As the social media manager, I managed the magazine's Facebook and Instagram accounts by posting original and entrepreneur-related content three times a week. I also organized three awards for StartUp, Rookie, and Innovator of the Year. This included designing nomination forms, processing submissions, and choosing the winner in each category.</p>
