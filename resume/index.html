I compiled a monthly "event scroll" comprised of entrepreneurial events in the Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. areas that was published online for our readers. As the social media manager, I managed the magazine's Facebook and Instagram accounts by posting original and entrepreneur-related content three times a week.
