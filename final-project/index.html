      <p>2018 has been a record year for the Port of Baltimore: record number of cars and light trucks handled in May and then again in August, best fiscal year, best quarter and best first sixth months, according to a press release from the Maryland Port Administration. But despite these records, uncertainty looms. </p>

      <p>The Trump Administration announced a series of tariffs earlier this year, seeking to offset low-price imports and impact alleged bad trade practices by countries such as China. Among the proposed tariffs, President Donald Trump called for a 10 percent levy on imported aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, both of which went into effect on June 1.</p>

      <p>The steel and aluminum tariffs are projected to cost U.S. firms about $9 billion, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax policy nonprofit. An additional $200 billion worth of goods imported from China will face a 10 percent duty, the Trump Administration announced in September.</p>

      <p>In total, these proposed tariffs will potentially affect an estimated 8.4 percent of trade, according to the President and CEO of The American Association of Port Authorities.</p>

      <p>Beyond the ports, these tariffs could also have a negative impact on the economy as cargo activities supply more than 23 million jobs and generate over $320 billion in taxes.</p>

      <p>The Port of Baltimore in particular employs 13,000 individuals directly and 127,000 indirectly, according to Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger who represents the Port.</p>

      <p>The tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are projected to significantly impact Maryland. According to Census Bureau data analyzed by the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, steel and aluminum constituted 5.5 percent of Maryland’s total imports in 2017, more than double the national average of 2 percent.</p>

        <p>2017 was the third-highest year on record for tons of cargo handled as well as the seventh consecutive year that Maryland handled more cars and light trucks than any other state, according to an Oct. 18 MPA Press Release. </p>

        <p>So far, the possible negative effects of the tariffs have yet to be reflected in the Port of Baltimore’s trade returns. In fact, the Port of Baltimore still leads the nation in automobiles transactions; they handled a record-setting 65,281 cars and light trucks in August.</p>

      <p>Some argue that the Port’s current success is a result of sell-offs before the tariffs take effect. And there are other foreboding signs.</p>

      <p>The Associated Press recently reported that General Motors will lay off more than 14,000 workers across North America and five plants, including one in Baltimore. Though the majority of the vehicles made in the White Marsh plant are sold outside of the U.S., the cuts will still impact the $7.3 million it pays in income tax, according to GM’s website.</p>

      <p>Statistics from the State Ports Authority show October was another month of decline in BMW exports through the Port of Charleston, the fourth in a row.</p>

      <p>Back in Maryland, the MPA states that BMW is one of the Port of Baltimore’s largest auto customers. The CEO of Ford, another significant company for the Port, estimated that the tariffs on aluminum and steel cost them about $1 billion more just for the raw materials.</p>

      <p>In 2017, China was second among the Port of Baltimore's largest trade partners. In the year to date, China has fallen to fourth, accounting for 7.5 percent of trade with Baltimore, over one percentage point less than last year.

      <p>The White House began considering recommendations from the U.S. Commerce Department about whether to impose possible tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts, two administration officials told Reuters. The President has threatened to enact these tariffs unless the European Union and Japan make certain trade compromises and are projected to significantly increase the cost of making and buying cars.</p>

      <p>In early December, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for dinner during the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina to talk trade. Trump said the talks constituted a "big leap forward" as part of his larger goal to fulfill a campaign promise to end China's supposedly unfair trade practices.</p>

      <p>With few details initially forthcoming - aside from words of a possible ceasefire and unsubstantiated boasts from Tump - the announcement sparked sudden highs and lows in the economy. Monday, following the meeting, the Dow  Jones Industrial Average rose almost 300 points. It was the closest the Dow has come to reclaiming positive gains for 2018 since the beginning of November. By the next day, however, the Dow plunged almost 800 points, or 3.1%, just from Monday, Dec. 3 to Tuesday, Dec. 4 as additional information about the meeting was released.</p>

      <p>It will likely take more time and data to see how the tariffs affect the Port of Baltimore beyond the announcement and initial implementation stages. The tariffs coupled with the loss of the GM plant could significantly impact the Port of Baltimore’s automobile industry, which the MPA said counted for 11% of their processed tonnage in 2016. There is the possibility for harm, but the economy - despite its recent steep slide - could surprise again.</p>
